- :dolphin: **I develop software for ANSYS Inc.'s flagship Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) product, ANSYS Fluent**. 
- :racehorse: **Things I specialize in**: Software development for CFD and other scientific programming applications. Started from the math and now we're here!
- ðŸ”­ **Things I'm good at**: High Performance Computing (HPC) - OpenMP, MPI and CUDA programming. I started my internal monologue on computer architecture and operating systems during my initial days of HPC, and I haven't shut up since!
- ðŸŒ± **Things I'm getting better at**: Full stack development focused on making portable and lightweight applications. Boy, this needs work...
- :email: **What you should check out**: I maintain a blog at  <a href="https://mustafabhotvawala.com/">www.mustafabhotvawala.com</a>. Along with CFD content, I've been trying to write about computers and code.
